  <p class="project_desc_pdf">
  Taking a print class was one of the best decisions I have ever made. I found that formatting pages and placing elements was very enjoyable to me. Seeing an editorial come to fruition became addicting.
  <br><br>
  This project features 8 pages of layout examples. Some of the writing is original and some writing is displayed as filler. You can view the pdf <u><a class="project_a" href="images/magazine.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a></u>

  <p class="project_desc_pdf">
  In the music world, I am known as "somburd", and I perform live beat sets with other musicians. I was given the chance to create a poster for the event.
  <br><br>
  To the give the poster a record shop feel I found a dusty overlay to cover the graphic. Some of the color choices are heavily inspired by 80's VHS covers.

  This graphic is the base design for a poster assignment given in class, inspired by NASA promotional posters.

  <p class="project_title">Album Cover<br><br>Halcyon</p>
  <p class="project_desc_pdf">
  Like we're looking through a window... Literally. Halcyon is one of my favorite musical projects that I have completed. It is also my most sucessful release on Spotify and Soundcloud.
  <br><br>
  The album design is based around how I was feeling at the time it was made. I just had discovered what I wanted my career to be, looking through a window to an exciting future.

  <p class="project_title">Album Cover<br><br>Veloce</p>
  <p class="project_desc_pdf">
  Growing up as a kid, I loved classic Racing Games like "Need For Speed 3: Hot Pursuit".
  <br><br>
  Veloce embodies "speed", featuring fast and aggressive compositions.
  <br><br>
  I chose a type face that exemplified a sleek style. Like a car zooming past a camera leaving blurred lines behind it. Also, it features an old style monitor with a photo from the actual game. Just like the one I played on.

  <p class="project_title">EP Cover<br><br>Intrstllr Crane</p>
  <p class="project_desc_pdf">
  During design practice, I happened to create a paper crane graphic. The music I was creating at the time had a deep space vibe to it and it felt right to include "interstellar" in the name with a related graphic.
