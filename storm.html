  <p class="project_desc">
  I reached out to Micheal from Storm Enterprises and asked if he would like to see a redesign of his current website. We met and agreed to coordinate the plan. My design choices were based off of what WIX Provides since he required the site to be built on WIX.
  <br><br>
  Many of the websites product links were originally just sitting on the front page and were hard to read. Replacing this with a "featured product" landing page seemed optimal since he is continually aiming to sell current year products. The links would then be moved to a menu in the top-right corner.
  <br><br>
  Displaying the "solutions" on the site as a grid list instead of a bulleted list creates a better experience for the user looking for instant gratification.
  <br><br>
  This design features a swipe-able section to improve how the user gains information on the "Products And Services Offered". The previous design on the home page was too large and taking up a lot of space. It felt right to condense it.
  <br><br>
  While I am still in the process of finishing this product, I believe I am off to a good start and within strong buisness relations with the client.
